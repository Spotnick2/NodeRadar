# NodeRadar plan

**Goal:** while you ride with Find Herbs or Find Minerals on, a ping and a flash on the minimap
the moment a gathering node comes into range, so you never ride past one you didn't notice.

## Why v1 never worked

v1 (`NodeRadar.lua`, written for TBC Anniversary, Interface 20504) looked for the blips as
children of the Minimap: small, unnamed frames with a "gather-ish" texture. The client doesn't
draw tracking blips that way. They're drawn by the engine inside the Minimap widget and never
appear in `Minimap:GetChildren()`. So v1 could only ever see other addons' pins (HereBeDragons
icons from Questie, RXPGuides, ...), and its "any numeric texture is a blip" rule made those false
alerts. Its vignette fallback (`info.type == 2`) doesn't mean "gathering node" either.

## The candidate on Forever (#2)

Forever runs Blizzard's Mainline code, and its API dump (1.60.1.70425) has two calls that, put
together, would read the blips:

- **`Minimap:UpdateMouseoverAtPoint(pointX, pointY)`** (MinimapFrameAPI): moves the minimap's
  "what's under this point" to a point of our choosing. Nothing in Blizzard's UI calls it, so
  neither its coordinates nor whether it works from an addon are known.
- **`C_TooltipInfo.GetMinimapMouseover()`** returns that as TooltipData: what
  `GameTooltip:SetMinimapMouseover()` shows when you hover a blip ("Peacebloom"), which is how
  Blizzard's own minimap tooltip works (`Blizzard_Minimap/Mainline/Minimap.lua:269-272`).

Sampling a grid of points a few times a second would then give each node's name and where it is.
`Tools/NodeRadarProbe` measures it (docs/FOREVER-PROBE.md has the procedure and the results):

1. what the mouseover reads while the player really hovers a blip;
2. which coordinate convention brings the same name back with the cursor elsewhere (a far point
   first, so a stale answer can't pass);
3. what a whole-map sweep costs and finds;
4. whether sweeping disturbs the player's own hover tooltip;
5. a ride with a live radar;
6. the smaller things: mount detection, tracking by spell ID, vignettes, the sound, the ring.

**If the mouseover can't be driven:** a known-spawn database instead. Record where you gather
(`UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED` for the gathering spell plus the player's position, which reads plainly
outdoors, porting guide, 70374) and alert near a known spawn. Weaker: it says where a node *can*
be, not that one is up.

## The port (#3), after #2

- Detection: what #2 measures, or the fallback.
- Tracking from `C_Minimap.GetTrackingInfo` by **spell ID** (2383/8387 Find Herbs, 2580/8388 Find
  Minerals), never English names. No Find Gas Clouds: Forever is Vanilla content.
- `PlaySound(SOUNDKIT.MAP_PING)` is 3175; v1's 8332 was a wrong guess.
- Mounted: `IsMounted()`, `PLAYER_MOUNT_DISPLAY_CHANGED`. No unfiltered `UNIT_AURA`.
- Events through a `RegisterEvents` that reports failures; an options page; offline tests.
- Never move, reparent or resize `Minimap` or `MinimapCluster` (Edit Mode systems). The ring is
  our own unnamed frame on the map.

## A public API (#4), after #3

NodeRadar stays standalone: it reads Blizzard's `Minimap`, so it works under any skin (the stock
map, SexyMap, ElvUI, Glass MiniMap). It exposes `PUBLIC_API_VERSION` and a callback (name, kind,
position on the map); a skin that draws the alert itself (Glass MiniMap, as it does with Glass
MiniMap Bar) turns NodeRadar's own ring off.
